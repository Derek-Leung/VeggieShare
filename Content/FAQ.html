      <h3>What led to the creation of Preppy?</h3>
      <p>In the Metro Vancouver region, leftovers make up 20% of avoidable food waste. Avoidable food waste is food that could have
        been eaten, but was thrown away or composted instead, including uneaten leftovers or food that spoiled before it was used.
        Preppy is an application that aims to reduce food waste by providing a good estimate of how much ingredients you need for a specific serving size given a recipe you choose.</p>

        too much and either cook too much or throw away what we couldn't use! Preppy aims to target these mistakes!</p>
